I am Tarek Hoteit, vintage computing and retro gaming enthusiast. My passion in computers started as a kid playing Pacman on the Atari 2600. My parents got me a Commodore Vic-20 in the early eighties right when the Commodore 64 was being rolled out. I quickly realized that I wanted the Commodore 64, but that was not an easy wish to come true. It took me many years till I managed to get hold of one.... More to come on that one. If you like to know more about me, please check my main website [tarek.computer](https://www.tarek.computer).

This site is my personal space for vintage computing, retro gaming, and any related old-school tech material.
