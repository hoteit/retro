Hello. I love computers since childhood, so I put this retro-theme website for nostalgia and for my retro enthusiasm purposes. The look and feel of the site is based on the Commodore 64 stylesheet for Jekyll by [regmtait/
c64jekyll](https://github.com/regmtait/c64jekyll). The font is C64 TrueType and is available to download [here](http://style64.org/c64-truetype).
On this site, I will be sharing what I have been collecting in the vintage computing and retro gaming space. I will also regularly update the site with links to key web sources that I would find online.
